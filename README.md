## 🔧 Development

### Prerequisites

Copy
```
# Install CocoaPods
sudo gem install cocoapods
```
#### Install Xcode Command Line Tools
```
xcode-select --install
```
### Setup

Copy
```
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/snig-17/FlashChat.git
cd FlashChat
```
#### Install dependencies
```
pod install
```
#### Open workspace (not .xcodeproj)
open FlashChat.xcworkspace

### Firebase Configuration

1. Create new project in Firebase Console
1. Add iOS app with bundle identifier
1. Download GoogleService-Info.plist and add to Xcode project
1. Enable Firestore Database and Authentication in Firebase Console
1. Configure Authentication providers (Email/Password)

### Testing Flow

1. Launch app → Welcome screen with animated logo
1. Register → Create new account with email/password
1. Login → Access chat interface with existing credentials
1. Chat → Send/receive real-time messages with other users
1. Persistence → Messages remain after app restart

## 📱 Device Support

- iPhone - iOS 13.0+ with full feature support
- iPad - iPadOS 13.0+ with adaptive layouts
- Simulator - Full Xcode Simulator compatibility
- Network - Requires internet connection for real-time features

## 🎯 Performance

- Message Delivery: < 100ms real-time updates
- Authentication: < 2s login/registration flow
- Data Sync: Automatic background synchronization
- Offline Support: Message caching with sync on reconnection
- Memory Usage: Optimized with lazy loading and efficient cell reuse

## 🔐 Security
